3D CAD model of Crazyflie 2.0 Quadrotor

Crazyflie 2.0 is an opensource nano quadrotor by Bitcraze [https://www.bitcraze.io]. 

This repository contains a 3D CAD model of the quadrotor in Solidworks.

The model aims to represent as close as possible the dimensions and mass properties of the actual quadrotor. 
Additionally we have designed frames to hold motion capture markers and protect the quadrotor from collisions. They are intended to be either 3D printed or laser cut.
